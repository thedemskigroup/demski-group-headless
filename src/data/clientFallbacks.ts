// This module provides:
//   - a static fallback dataset, structured into the same sections used by
//     the live case-study template (Project / Solution / Key Features /
//     Results / Conclusion) — see public/Our Clients/* reference screenshots
//   - a normalizer that merges live API data with fallback data so every
//     case study page always has a complete set of sections to render
